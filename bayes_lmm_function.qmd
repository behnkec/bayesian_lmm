## Correlation Model

### Set prior

```{r}
prior <- c(prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept), # grand mean
                prior(normal(0, 10), class = b, coef = n_bnormal), # grand beta
                prior(normal(0, 50), class = sigma), # within person variation
                prior(normal(0, 20), class = sd, coef = Intercept, group = participant_id), # between person variation in mean 
                prior(normal(0, 20), class = sd, coef = n_bnormal, group = participant_id), # between person variation in slope
                prior(lkj(2), class = cor, group = participant_id)) # correlation between random intercept and random slope
```

### Function

fit <- function(erp, prior,  ) {
  
}
